## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Form Validation
```typescript
- Full name: Min 2 characters
- Email: RFC 5322 format
- Password: 8+ chars, mixed case, numbers
- Confirmation: Must match password
- Terms: Must be accepted
```

### Session Flow
```typescript
1. Sign up creates auth user
2. Profile created in database
3. Verification email sent
4. Email click validates token
5. Callback updates email_verified
6. Redirects based on profile state
```

### Error Handling
- Email already exists → "Sign in instead"
- Rate limit → "Try again later"
- Network error → Generic message
- All errors displayed inline

## ✨ Next Steps
