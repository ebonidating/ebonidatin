# Security Update - Repository Cleanup

## Actions Taken (2025-11-01)

### 1. Git Configuration Fixed ✅
- Updated local git user from "yuxermatic" to "ebonidating"
- Updated git email to "info@ebonidating.com"
- All future commits will show correct author

### 2. Branches Cleaned Up ✅
- Deleted remote branch: `master`
- Deleted remote branch: `staging-clean`
- Deleted local branch: `status`
- **Only `main` branch remains** (linked to Vercel)

### 3. Repository Status
- **Active Branch**: `main` only
- **Protection**: Unprotected (consider enabling)
- **Vercel Integration**: Connected to `main` branch

## Recommendations

### Enable Branch Protection
Go to GitHub Settings → Branches → Add Rule for `main`:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Include administrators
- ✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches

### Repository Access Control
1. Go to: https://github.com/ebonidating/ebonidatin/settings/access
2. Review collaborators
3. Remove any unauthorized users
4. Set appropriate permissions for team members

### Audit Recent Activity
1. Check: https://github.com/ebonidating/ebonidatin/settings/security_analysis
2. Review commit history
3. Enable security alerts

## Current Access
- Owner: ebonidating organization
- Collaborators: (Check GitHub settings)
